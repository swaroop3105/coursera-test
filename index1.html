		<p id="p1"> I am a BCA graduate and further I would like to pursue career in web developement type of job. Currently my dad is a factory labourer and my mother is a home maker. As I am a student even I'm unemployed and has a lot of student debt as well. I belong to a city called Pune in India and the cost of living is very high over here.I really need this financial aid because it is very difficult for a BCA graduate to find a decent job without any external certifications. I have a younger sister who is also studying so this certification would really help me find a better job and support my family. I’ve no job of my own to carry the expenses to pay for the certificate of this course. I live only for my scholarship. In this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid.  I hope you will take this into consideration and will do the needful.	</section>
